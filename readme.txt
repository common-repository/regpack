== Description ==
 
Put registration front and center on your website, not a 3rd party. 
Create a customized registration and online payment flow directly on your website easily with Regpack's [online registration software](https://www.regpacks.com/blog/online-registration-software/).

For current Regpack clients, please head to "Project Settings" in your Regpack account. 
From there, click the "Embedding" tab and copy the embed code for your project in the field below. You can read more about this in [here](https://www.regpacks.com/help/project-settings/embedding-regpack/).

Once you save the code below, a shortcode will be created, [regpack-shortcode], that you can then insert on any page or pages on your website.
If you are NOT a Regpack client, feel free to email sales@regpacks.com to learn more about how you can integrate your online registration process into your website.
